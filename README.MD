## Information

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to describing engineering standards for our projects. Here, you'll find guidelines and best practices for code conventions, ESLint configurations, and other engineering tools.

Code conventions are important for us to maintaining a consistent and readable codebase. By following the guidelines in this repository, our team can ensure that our code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. We'll also reduce the chance of introducing errors or inconsistencies.

We believe that following engineering standards is essential for building high-quality, maintainable software.
